            <p>
              Here’s the harsh truth: People are bored out of their minds when
              taking surveys. One person on Reddit said they watched Netflix
              when taking an academic survey. Another person said they chose to
              do the dishes halfway through a survey over a $10 gift coupon.
              Pretty sure, most of us feel that way.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of our efforts to understand both parties, we interviewed
              a group of marketing experts and customers independently.
            </p>

            <p>Here’s what the marketers told us:</p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  {" "}
                  Sure, survey data is vital to our efforts in understanding
                  customers. But we’ve been having low response rates lately.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Though we have chunks of data coming in through surveys, we’re
                  unsure of how to use them along with other data that we
                  collect.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We feel like there’s a gap between the analysis we make and
                  the decisions we take. There must be a better way to make use
                  of all this data we’re sitting on.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We’re able to get customers to take our surveys. But we’re
                  facing challenges in making the best use of them.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              We’re sure a lot of marketing resonates with the above concerns.
              And customers’ opinions of surveys shouldn’t appear surprising
              either:
            </p>

              {" "}
              <ul>
                <li>
                  “Boring. It’s always the same question rephrased in 10
                  different ways.”{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  “The last survey I left halfway through was simply irrelevant.
                  I had some concerns to share, but there was no such option.”{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  “I have completed a few surveys, but the longer ones are
                  undoable.”{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  “Sometimes, it’s like talking to a wall. We take the time to
                  complete the survey but are companies listening to us?”{" "}

            </p>
            <p>
              It’s clear from the above statements that we have some gaps that

              <h3>Taking surveys should be a walk in the park</h3>
              <div className="clearfix"></div>Marketers often swear by surveys
              as a sure-shot way of understanding customer behavior. And they’re
              not wrong. Surveys are often good indicators of a customer’s
              choices and preferences, both at an individual and collective
              scale. For example, an analysis of an online bookstore survey data
              may reveal that customer A loves reading hard-boiled fiction,
              customer B likes crime fiction set during the 90s, and so on. It
              offers a microscopic view of the likes, dislikes, choices, and
              preferences at the customer level. And when extrapolated, it may
              show a growing interest in crime fiction, a collective preference.
              In a similar manner, periodic surveys are a great way for
              marketers to look at the general shift in the trend and adapt to
              meet those changing needs. They’re also useful in gathering honest
              feedback from customers to learn what needs to change.
            </p>
            <p>
              Attention, marketers! The only way to get customers to complete
              surveys is to:{" "}
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>

                <b>Tell customers up-front what they should expect.</b> We’ve
                observed that including the purpose, time estimate, and a small
                incentive can improve your chances.{" "}
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Be creative in designing the survey.</b> Focus on design,
                font, accessibility, and responsiveness. Maybe add a progress
                bar?{" "}
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Keep the survey short and to the point.</b>Survey fatigue is
                real and can lead to rushed, not well-thought-out responses.{" "}
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Connect with your customer.</b> Ask questions that are
                relevant. Keep questions simple and straightforward. Nothing a
                customer cannot do without a few clicks.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Care for your customer. </b>Design questions that elicit
                feedback from customers. And remember, the best questions are
                those that aim to solve a customer’s problems and truly
                understand their needs.{" "}
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let’s start with an example to understand this better:</p>
            <p>
              <i>“Your Choice”</i> is a retail brand that is planning to invest
              resources into better understanding its customers. They plan to
              collect survey data over a period from customers across different
              segments. They want to design their surveys to be fun and
              interactive, offering a coupon card for those who complete it. The
              data types collected from surveys are both <b>quantitative</b> and{" "}

              <h4>Customer Satisfaction Survey (Quantitative)</h4>
              <div className="clearfix"></div>There’s no better metric than a
              customer satisfaction survey to quantify customer sentiment and
              happiness. Combined with other sources of data, it can contribute

              <h5 className="m-0">Product Feedback Survey (Qualitative)</h5>
              All well-designed surveys have a question or two related to
              product quality and experience. It’s a great way to understand a
              customer’s perception of the product and explore their likes,
              dislikes, and preferences. An in-depth analysis (text and
              sentiment analysis) of this data can help companies work towards
              the betterment of their products based on the feedback they
              receive. Some sample questions include:

            </p>
            <p>
              Ideally, a good survey should also allow customers to provide
              additional feedback beyond what they have already answered in the
              survey.{" "}

                  </tbody>
                </table>
              </div>
              The table is a <b>gold mine.</b> It combines survey data with
              other data sources, such as total purchases, total spending, and
              last purchase data, to provide a unified view. Note that this is
              only a sample, and any real-world dataset would have over a
              million rows and 100s of additional columns. Let’s look at two
              scenarios now, where we learn how best to make use of survey data.
            </p>
<p><h5>Analyzing survey data in isolation 
</h5><div className="clearfix"></div>As you must be already familiar with, conducting analysis on survey data in isolation can help you understand the customer sentiment in relation to the survey questions. Let’s say we’re analyzing the text box section. There are reviews, such as: 
<ul>
    <li>"I had a fantastic shopping experience! The staff was friendly, and I found everything I needed."</li>
    <li>"The quality of the products was okay. The product collection is meh."</li>
    <li>"The checkout process was quick and hassle-free. I'll definitely shop here again."</li>
    <li>"Terrible service Staff is super rude too!"
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Classifying this into positive, negative, and neutral can help the marketing team focus on customer pain points, improve aspects that fall under the neutral category, and continue to maintain areas that customers were impressed/satisfied with. </p>
           
                <p>Going through the four comments, it’s clear that 50% of customers expressed positive sentiments, 25% expressed negative sentiments, and 25% had neutral sentiments. And over time, you would track the % change in people bucketed into each of these categories. </p>
<p>When analyzed in isolation, you can bet on:<ul>
    <li>Quicker insights and faster action </li>
    <li>Identifying common issues</li>
    <li>Understanding customer sentiment 
</li></ul></p>
<p>What you’ll miss out on:<ul>
    <li>The context in which events occur</li>
    <li>Predicting future customer behavior </li>
    <li>Depth of customer insights </li></ul> </p>
    <p>It’s best to start with analyzing survey data in isolation, and then work on combining it with other data sources to get richer customer insights.
    <p>
    Several marketers, however, find it challenging to combine/integrate data. Some concerns they shared with us include: 
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>“So much data is overwhelming and we end up using only a few.” </li>
            <li>“Integrating with different tools is complex” </li>
            <li>“Subscribing to multiple tools for data collection, cleaning, and integration has increased our costs and is difficult to keep track of”. 
</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
<p>This can be easily addressed by using a one-click integration tool, so it becomes easier to gather fragmented data across multiple sources. While you’re deciding, make sure to look for a tool that helps set up automated data pipelines to collect, ingest, preprocess, and integrate data into a unified view/format. 
</p>
<p><h5>Combining survey data with other data sources: Correlation </h5><div className="clearfix"></div>
Combining the survey data with other data sources is absolutely necessary for getting a more holistic view of customer behavior. The table above is a merge of survey data along with multiple other data sources. Only through a unified view can you correlate survey responses with factors like demographics, purchase history, or online shopping behavior. Let’s say, for example, customers with high satisfaction ratings usually spend more or that people in a particular age group <b>AND</b> neutral satisfactory ratings may spend less. These correlations are useful in making more informed decisions. But they’re nowhere close to getting you to predicting churn, let alone understanding it, or helping you move from personalization to hyper-personalization. What next, then? 
</p>

<p><h5>Combining survey data with other data sources: Predictive modeling </h5><div className="clearfix"></div>
Only a tool with predictive modeling capabilities trained on historical and recent data (survey data + other quantitative and qualitative data) can anticipate future customer behavior!  
</p>
<p>Taking the example of the table above, what we want to predict is whether a customer would churn. Multiple variables influence churn, of course. In large datasets, it becomes impossible to understand what factors might cause customers to leave. In such scenarios, a tool with predictive modeling capabilities can find patterns and connections that you didn’t even know existed! And these connections can help you learn “why” customers left. Now you have a list of customers who may churn, how likely they might churn, and the reason for churn. You have all the <b>“drivers of churns”.</b> </p>
<p>With the knowledge of factors that influence churn and the magnitude of their impact,  you can re-visit your marketing strategies both at the customer level and overall. At the customer level, you can focus on having one-on-one interactions with at-risk customers to understand their concerns and provide swift resolutions. Overall, you can understand the most common issues that customers face and re-direct resources to resolve them. For instance, if the “un-friendly UI” is a common issue, you can focus on making the website more easy to navigate, accessible, and intuitive. </p>

<p>Not only churn, but you can also get a list of <b>high-value customers</b> (those with the lowest churn scores) and focus on <b>cross-selling </b>or <b>up-selling </b>products to them.  
From ticket management and marketing campaign optimization to product development, a tool with advanced analytics and predictive modeling capabilities can accelerate your marketing efforts multi-fold!
